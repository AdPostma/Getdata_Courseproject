#Codebook Samsungmeandata

This is the codebook for the file samsungmeandata. The file contains a tidy subset of measurements collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

The orininal data are contained in: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A description of the project and the original data can be found in:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


This codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data.

##Original data 

The orinal data contain measurements from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

For each record was provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
 
The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt' on the website described above.

##Work on the original data
The following modifications have been made to the raw data file to create the samsungmeandata file, the exact steps are described in the readme.md:
-	the training and the test sets ware mergede to create one data set
-	only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted. The meanfrequency measurements were not extracted. Of a total of 561 features, 66 mean and standard deviation features were selected  
-	the activities in the data set were factorised to descriptive activity names 
-	appropriately labels with descriptive variable names were used to relabel the data set
-	an independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. For this tidy data set a “long form” was chosen to make the samsungmeandata set better readable.

## Descriptive variable names

In the original dataset variablenames were abriviated. These abreviated names were written out to get descriptive variable names by substituting:
-	t = timesignalof
-	f = frequencysignalof
-	Body = body
-	BodyBody = body (BodyBody is obviously a typo)
-	Gravity = gravity
-	Acc = linearacceleration
-	Gyro = angularvelocity
-	Mag = magnetude
-	Jerk = jerk
-	mean = mean
-	std = standarddeviation
-	X = inxdirection
-	Y = inydirection
-	Z = inzdirection
-	()  was omitted
-	_   was omitted

In the last step to create a "long form" tidy dataset the 66 descriptive variablenames were transformed into 66 levels of the factor variable "measurements"
